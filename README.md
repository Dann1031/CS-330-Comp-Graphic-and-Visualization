# How do I approach designing software?
When designing my 3D graphics scene, I began by identifying the requirements (such as including multiple 3D objects, textures, lighting, and camera controls). From there, I broke the problem down into manageable parts: designing objects, applying transformations, mapping textures, and coding user input for camera navigation. My approach was both modular and iterative — I built one feature at a time (for example, the pyramid shape, then textures, then lighting), tested it, and refined the design before moving on.

# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project strengthened several design skills:
Scene composition – learning how to position and scale 3D objects to create a coherent environment.
Texture mapping – experimenting with applying different textures (such as brick for the pyramid) without stretching or distortion.
Camera and navigation design – setting up WASD and mouse controls to make the scene interactive.
Lighting design – choosing how to combine ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting to highlight textures and create realism.

# What design process did you follow for your project work?
My design process followed these steps:
Requirement analysis – reviewing the project instructions to understand what objects, textures, and interactions were required.
Planning – sketching out the scene layout and deciding which OpenGL shapes and transformations to use.
Prototyping – building basic shapes first (cube, sphere, pyramid), then testing transformations to match the scene.
Feature layering – adding textures, then lights, then camera controls in incremental steps.
Testing and refining – running the program frequently to check for correct texture alignment, smooth navigation, and realistic lighting.

# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The tactics I practiced in this project can be applied in future software projects:
Iterative development (building and testing in layers) prevents being overwhelmed by complexity.
Modular design (shapes, textures, camera, and lighting as separate concerns) makes projects easier to manage and expand.
User interaction focus (designing smooth camera controls) can translate to better UI/UX in other applications.
Attention to visual detail (textures and lighting) is a transferable skill for any project involving graphics, interfaces, or simulations.

# How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs by breaking the overall project into smaller, manageable tasks and tackling them one at a time. I start with the core functionality first (like creating basic 3D shapes) and then gradually add more complex features (textures, lighting, and camera movement). I also focus on testing each piece as I go, so that errors can be caught early and fixed before moving on.

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
While building the 3D scene, I used several new strategies:
Incremental building – I developed one feature at a time (objects → textures → lighting → camera controls).
Experimentation and adjustment – testing different texture coordinates and lighting values to see how they impacted the scene.
Reusability – writing functions that could be reused for multiple shapes or transformations instead of rewriting code.
Debugging through visualization – using the rendered output itself as feedback to quickly identify misplaced objects or incorrect lighting setups.

# How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was a critical part of the process. Each milestone served as a checkpoint where I could test progress, reflect on what worked, and then improve or expand. For example, I first built a pyramid with simple transformations, then iterated by applying a brick texture, then refined it by adjusting lighting to highlight the texture properly. The cycle of testing, adjusting, and improving helped me gradually move from a rough draft scene to a polished final project.

# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
At the beginning, my focus was on simply making objects appear on screen. As the milestones progressed, my approach became more structured and strategic. I learned to:
Plan features ahead of time instead of rushing into code.
Build in layers so I could test features independently.
Rely more on modularity, organizing code so different parts of the scene (shapes, textures, lighting, camera) were easier to manage.
Think not just about functionality, but also about user experience (smooth camera navigation, realistic lighting, coherent scene design).

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science helps me reach my goals by giving me the skills to solve problems through technology. It teaches me how to break down challenges into smaller steps, design efficient solutions, and think logically about systems. These skills are not only useful for programming, but also for any career that involves problem-solving, critical thinking, or working with data. By building a strong foundation in computer science, I am preparing myself to create software, design applications, and pursue opportunities in areas like software development, security, or graphics programming.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Working with computational graphics has given me new technical knowledge in areas like 3D modeling, texture mapping, lighting, and camera controls. More importantly, it has improved my spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills — for example, understanding how transformations affect objects in a scene or how different lighting models change how an object looks. These skills carry over into future coursework in areas like computer graphics, game design, simulations, and even data visualization. They also reinforce my understanding of math and programming concepts, which strengthens my foundation for more advanced computer science classes.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Professionally, computational graphics has taught me how to combine creativity with technical skills. Learning how to design and program a 3D scene requires thinking not just about code, but also about user interaction, realism, and presentation. These skills can translate into careers involving game development, simulation design, or software that relies on visualization (such as scientific modeling or UI/UX design). Even outside of graphics, the problem-solving, modular design, and iterative development strategies I practiced will help me in any software engineering or technology career.
